# Olist E-Commerce SQL Analytics Project

An end-to-end SQL analytics project built using the Olist Brazilian E-Commerce dataset and MySQL.  
The project demonstrates a complete analytics workflow from raw data exploration to business insights and advanced SQL concepts.

---

## Project Overview

This project follows a structured, real-world SQL analytics approach:

1. Schema exploration and understanding of raw tables  
2. Data validation to identify data quality issues  
3. Non-destructive data cleaning using SQL views  
4. Analytical modeling using fact and dimension views  
5. Business analysis and KPI generation  
6. Advanced SQL using CTEs and window functions

## Key Highlights

- Performed schema inspection and row-level validation before analysis  
- Identified and handled data quality issues such as inconsistent delivery timelines and sparse reviews  
- Applied data cleaning using SQL views to preserve raw data integrity  
- Built analytical fact and dimension views for scalable analysis  
- Analyzed revenue, average order value, seller performance, delivery timelines, and customer behavior  
- Demonstrated advanced SQL concepts including CTEs, window functions, ranking, running totals, and percentage contribution

## Tools & Skills

- MySQL  
- SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries)  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, SUM OVER)  
- Data Validation & Cleaning  
- Analytical Modeling  
- Business Analysis  

---

## Dataset

Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset (public dataset available on Kaggle).

---

## Notes

- Raw tables were preserved without modification  
- All cleaning and transformations were implemented using SQL views  
- Business metrics were calculated only on cleaned, analysis-ready data  

---

## Outcome

This project showcases the ability to design, validate, clean, and analyze real-world relational data using SQL, while applying both foundational and advanced SQL concepts in a structured and explainable manner.
